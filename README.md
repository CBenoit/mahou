# Mahou
## Magically easy anime downloader

## How to use
```bash
cargo install mahou
mahou
```

That's it! If it doesn't find the `mahou` executable, try adding `~/.cargo/bin`
to your `$PATH`.

Heavily inspired by [anime-cli](https://github.com/DeGuitard/anime-cli) (if it was a library I would have used it instead of... copying code from it... :/)
